# ALM website - My portfolio & online resume

Hello!
Welcome on my resume/portfolio project.
The project contains some on my best projects along with my education, formations, information and goals.

### Project's goal

I wanted a website that matches my personality and shows my skills to recruteurs.
And it was a great oportunity to practice and sharpened my skills!

### Technologies

This is a full WordPress project. The animations are in Jquery for the most part and I used SASS for the CSS.
The project was installed with composer and requires NPM and Webpack to make the theme work properly.
The activated theme (myCV) is from me. 

### What will you find in this project?

You'll find some custom-post-type created as plugins, lots of features coded in the customizer and a multi-language plugin called WPML that I use to make my site available in French and English.
